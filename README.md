# Game-Off-2017

# Hi there!!
You're here looking for JoeZ's entry into [Game Off 2017](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2017), right? You're in the right place. Here you can follow my development and progress, look through the images and assets (when I get to them), and download and run the current version of my game.

When the game is all completed and packaged up, you'll be able to download it on [itch.io](http://itch.io/) or from this page through that "# releases" link up above.

## Running the game
Until the game is completed, here's how you can check out the "in progress" version of the game.

1. Download the appropriate version of [Love2D](http://love2d.org/) for your operating system. This game uses version 0.10.
2. Click the green "Clone or Download" button in the upper right of this page.
3. Click "Download Zip"
4. Unzip the folder. You should now have a folder called Game-Off-2017-master with some lua files, a couple folders, a README file and a RUNME file.
5. If you downloaded one of the installers during step 1 and are on Windows, just double-click the RUNME file to run the game.
6. If you downloaded one of the zip files during step 1, unzip it, find the love.exe or love.app file, and drag-and-drop the Game-Off-2017-master folder onto the love.exe or love.app file.
7. If all else fails, read the "Running Games" section on the [Love2D Wiki](http://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started)

After you've gone through this process once, you'll only need to repeat steps 2-7 to get and play the latest version of the game.

## Controls
The blue box is you. Use the arrow keys to move around. Hold the Z key to pick up the red ball. Release the Z key to throw the ball and watch it bounce around.

# My Notes
The theme this year is "throwback." I don't think I'm going to have a lot of time to work on this, so the simpler the better. Just a catch and throw game. Something similar to Breakout but with Tetris-style progression. Maybe something like Burger Time where you have to catch and throw things back into buckets in a certain order. Or a package sorter where you are pummeled by colored balls and you have to put them in the right buckets on the other side of the room. I want to try using a gamepad for this project, so the user will be able to aim using the joystick. I shouldn't rely on that though. WASD should still work for this. That means not restricting the player's movement and allowing them to move into the right position so that a cardinal direction would still allow them to aim.

I seem to be stuck on this food idea. I could have the person put together spaghetti and meatball meals. That can be put together in any order and needs pasta, meatballs, and sauce. 3 is a good number. I can also throw trash at the player. I just need to figure out how to ramp up the difficulty. I will either need hazards and some method of gradually preventing the player from building meals, or I can just add a flat timer and give them a star or score rating.

Is there any other game type where I can use a catch-and-throw mechanic and still have it be fun? Maybe this is the part where I start playing around with some mechanics.
