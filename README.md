# Game-Off-2017

https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2017

The theme this year is "throwback." I don't think I'm going to have a lot of time to work on this, so the simpler the better. Just a catch and throw game. Something similar to Breakout but with Tetris-style progression. Maybe something like Burger Time where you have to catch and throw things back into buckets in a certain order. Or a package sorter where you are pummeled by colored balls and you have to put them in the right buckets on the other side of the room. I want to try using a gamepad for this project, so the user will be able to aim using the joystick. I shouldn't rely on that though. WASD should still work for this. That means not restricting the player's movement and allowing them to move into the right position so that a cardinal direction would still allow them to aim.

I seem to be stuck on this food idea. I could have the person put together spaghetti and meatball meals. That can be put together in any order and needs pasta, meatballs, and sauce. 3 is a good number. I can also throw trash at the player. I just need to figure out how to ramp up the difficulty. I will either need hazards and some method of gradually preventing the player from building meals, or I can just add a flat timer and give them a star or score rating.
